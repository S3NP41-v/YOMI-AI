### What is this?
its a simple project i wanted to do in order to get a deeper understanding on the workings of neural nets and genetic algorithms

pre-trained model in "data/hwModel.model"

be aware of the settings in "data/settings.json" these are the settings i trained the AI in, i have 8 cores, and it used ~80% of them during training
